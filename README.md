# speech-recognition
### Final project for INFO1601

This is a simple web application that uses the SpeechRecognition interface of the Web Speech API.
We also made use of the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to fulfil the 3rd party API requirement.

You can use the application [here](https://danieldcaesar.github.io/speech-recognition/public)
